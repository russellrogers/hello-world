To Whom It May Concern,

I cannot imagine why anyone would be reading this but if you are, please know that when I was younger, my neighbor Marzy stole some of my
YuGiOh cards out of my garage when I went inside to get something and I have truly never recovered from that betrayal. If you see Marzy on 
the streets, please consider him armed with my YuGiOh cards and dangerous...to others with vulnerable YuGiOh cards and if the person 
reading this IS Marzy, know that I am coming for you and congratulations on the wedding a couple years back.

Sincerely,
russellrogers
